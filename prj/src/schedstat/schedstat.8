.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes ('\-\-').
.br
A summary of options is included below.
.\" For a complete description, see the Info files.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-affinity[=PROC-SPLIT]
Run threads on the set of processors given by PROC-SET.  If PROC-SET is not
specified, all processors will be used.  Threads will be assigned to processors
in the set in numeric order, in a round\-robin fashion.
.br
The set of processors can be specified as A,B,C, or A-C, or A-B,D-F, and so on*.
The ! character can be used to negate a set.  For example, !B-D means to use all
available CPUs except B through D.  The cpu numbers are the same as shown in the 
.I processor
field in /proc/cpuinfo.  See numa(3) for more information on specifying CPU sets.
* Support for CPU sets requires libnuma version >= 2.  For libnuma v1, PROC-SET,
if specified, must be a single CPU number.
.TP
.B \-b
Send break trace command when latency > USEC
.TP
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clock=CLOCK
select clock
.br
0 = CLOCK_MONOTONIC (default)
.br
1 = CLOCK_REALTIME
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-distance=DIST
Distance of thread intervals in us, default = 500
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-fifo=<path>
Create a named pipe at path and write stats to it
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-interval=INTV
Set the base interval of the thread(s) in microseconds (default is 1000us). This sets the interval of the first thread. See also \-d.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-loops=LOOPS
Set the number of loops. The default is 0 (endless). This option is useful for automated tests with a given number of test cycles. Cyclictest is stopped once the number of timer intervals has been reached.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mlockall
Lock current and future memory allocations to prevent being paged out
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-prio=PRIO
Set the priority of the first thread. The given priority is set to the first test thread. Each further thread gets a lower priority:
Priority(Thread N) = max(Priority(Thread N\-1) \- 1, 0)
.TP
.B \-\-policy=NAME
set the scheduler policy of the measurement threads
where NAME is one of: other, normal, batch, idle, fifo, rr
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Print a summary only on exit. Useful for automated tests, where only the summary output needs to be captured.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-threads[=NUM]
Set the number of test threads (default is 1). Create NUM test threads. If NUM is not specified, NUM is set to
the number of available CPUs. See \-d, \-i and \-p for further information.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unbuffered
force unbuffered output for live processing
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Output values on stdout for statistics. This option is used to gather statistical information about the latency distribution. The output is sent to stdout. The output format is:

n:c:v

where n=task number c=count v=latency value in us.
.TP
.B \\-w, \-\-wakeup
task wakeup tracing (used with \-b)
