README for polenaRT-install and polenaRT-config

==============
 INTRODUCTION
==============

'polenaRT' is an environment for running real-time capable `Moby`-compatible containers and reconfiguring its run-time environment based on state-of-the-art best practices.

The code is currently maintained on GitHub at

	git@github.com:flhofer/real-time-containers.git

The shell scripts accept parameters to adapt the created environment to your needs. See below for parameter usage.

==============
 REQUIREMENTS
==============

The 'polenaRT' scriptss run on any GNU/Linux compliant system with an (x)sh style shell interpreter. It needs the following software, built in or separate to function:
* (package mgr)		(a distro dependent package manager)
* curl				(to fetch and install additional software)
* sudo				(if not acting as root)
* tar				(to extract contents of source packages)
* patch				(to apply the RT patch)
* wget				(temp - to fetch data from web remote)

in addition, the configuration script will use
* taskset			(to set thread affinity)
* ps				(for process detection)
* awk				(data filtering)

=======
 USAGE
=======

Options available as of this version

* for polenaRT-install the parameters are as follows

./polenaRT-install.sh [patch-version] [balena-tag] [docker-tag] 

The default values are 6.1.77-rt24 v20.10.19 and v25.0.3 respectively.

./polenaRT-configure.sh does not have parameters as of this moment.


=============
 EXAMPLE RUN
=============

The following command presents a possible running scenario:

	$ ./polenaRT-install.sh

The script will verify permissions and automatically install the dependencies for a kernel buid on the system it is running on, At the moment of writing, to switch distro just run the script inside a container of the target system.
Then, it will check if there is a kernel config file for the selected version (argument 1) in the format `[ditstro]-[machine]-[version]-[patch].config`, e.g. `ubuntu-x86_64-6.1.77-rt24.config`. If there is no file, it will fetch the directory of configurations in the repository and prompt for a selection.
Once selected, the kernel version will be built and installed. Finally, the user will be prompted to install (or not) either a docker or balena engine with the version specified above.
